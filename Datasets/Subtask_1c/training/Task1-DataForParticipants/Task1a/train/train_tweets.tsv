SMM4H2022JaGANrleXz3ZWoRH	@USER_____ why i came off it. gp told me its not dangerous but it is damn unpleasant. at least i know it's the quetiapine that's causing it
SMM4H2022EdeuGU47chmn7v3M	damn you quetiapine side effect. was quite enjoying being able to sleep at night
SMM4H202261HBeAkN6Y8VyE2c	still a slightly fast pulse this morning. i know this is the quetiapine
SMM4H2022oO0Sijb2XA5lWXOU	@USER___________ many congratualtions for being able to come off quetiapine - i have read that and clozapine are the worst for withdrawals
SMM4H2022LIyWAaX9qw2hgLcW	@USER________ quetiapine knocked me sidewards for a week then I suddenly woke up activated. Then relapsed, upped dose, activated & so on
SMM4H20223M1x1TysCKaBkdq2	@USER_______ well no. but it's just that i dropped my quetiapine last night. i slept horribly! but i feel v unfoggy...

SMM4H2022YcdfnJGyPZn7AcVm	@USER__________ Taking someone off 150mg off Seroquel, mixing it with Olanzapine in 2 wks causes psychosis - a proper assess was not done.

SMM4H2022fMoIBgU8rmrJEBXf	seroquel is causing more gaps in memory, I don't remember going to therapy and as usual no one has stepped up to claim thos memories >>
SMM4H20225EszuCz7Ge3JZ8dZ	@USER_______ No more SSRI’s for me. They kept giving me manic reactions, usually angry. The Seroquel has me feeling too tired. It’s brutal
SMM4H2022Teu9BEjWFcGMWc71	@USER___________ Getting off Seroquel (Sero-KILL) can cause convulsions, fever, toxic reactions, psychotic reactions. and other shit
SMM4H20221Ha2fxuSoXds6CTY	"seroquel census: ""did we kiss?"" (notes i scribble next to my bed at 5am, loopy on anti-psychotics)"

SMM4H2022wCoH6i5yOSyfoAUi	damn you seroquel! why you only let me sleep four hours!?!?

SMM4H20225YeYaUbt5EEe15qw	oops meant to say janice ian. that's why my doctor took me off seroquel... because it makes me retarded.
SMM4H20228ew7FnlYi4Ak3rYc	fuck seroquel. i need to be awake
SMM4H2022LgMhq32RMdSDUHh1	I need to progress onto oxazepam.Apparently it's more sedating. Seroquel is sedating, but you can hardly open or close your mouth.
SMM4H2022zj1GcH2Z3RV3FgDR	"no fail, seroquel does make you hungry."
SMM4H2022vW1xlFNOyoAUSs8F	@USER_________ It's called Seroquel Prolong (Quetiapine). Apart from the weight gain, I am actually quite happy with it.

SMM4H2022KZjjec0xf5VaPrYt	tysabri infusion #54 yesterday. made me feel tired and out of it for a while. maybe it's the heat - 34c (94f)!!! maybe a very hot summer?
SMM4H2022MQuenQcSVHOfdSLv	@USER_____ i had a gene test for tysabri i guess it can cause a fatal brain disorder. my chances are low.. but that crap is creepy.

SMM4H2022e6NHOFIPRmPJ0Rea	@USER__________ Venlafaxine gave me horrendous nightmares, & coming of it was horrific.!
SMM4H2022mDKg3W12hi5cN43S	seem to be feeling a bit better. disturbed sleep is a problem though. #venlafaxine #day15
SMM4H2022EAcyijCLPfG02nH9	i can't see the point in taking #venlafaxine it's screwing up my sleep &amp; i'm pretty sure it's not helping with the depression.
SMM4H2022CZyPQmDl9PRGfUst	@USER___ same with venlafaxine, 1 user I spoke to yrs ago stopped taking that when she started having acid like trips losing hours at a time
SMM4H20227XjAnbKOtw7hpWOK	"as are (probably) the nausea, headache, sweats, flu symptoms &amp; diarrhea. but it's still better than being on it.  #venlafaxine #withdrawal"

SMM4H2022dXyHpYXMkGIjL5uJ	@USER_________ venlafaxine was always awful for that. like someone sprayed hairspray all over my tongue... eww isn't a strong enough word!
SMM4H2022lacusSLxLO1ipHIZ	coming off 150mg venlafaxine over 14 days was a better idea in discussion. my brain feels like its actually vibrating! #willpower
SMM4H20226oDjeuRpyPJAjoSF	anyone who will listen: never ever take effexor/venlafaxine. paraesthesia abound.
SMM4H20226ozTP9rD1MOl1I7y	day 3 without #venlafaxine. worst drug ever to withdraw from? any support much appreciated!
SMM4H2022UKLZpQz3lbhUNjEA	"so anyway last night.. my new medication (venlafaxine/effexor) made me feel the most depressed ever, and i overreacted about everything"
SMM4H2022FRbsK8jPN42JGdoG	"@USER_________ not sure. i took it with venlafaxine mostly, and think it was that which made me very tired"
SMM4H2022bsI3F5VF8xeoDgu8	@USER__________ yeah,  generic Venlafaxine has about four different slow release formulations,  I got withdrawals from some.
SMM4H2022K7GLg9he20TedqUS	packing whilst experiencing venlafaxine withdrawal is pretty hellish. got to keep track of my med times.
SMM4H2022GwzUi7DqYO7gOWe5	"@USER_________ not that i ever noticed. i was taking it with venlafaxine, and it definitely made me drowsy"
SMM4H2022THAxFCgLcffkZVUG	@USER_________ @USER_________ i didn't find it any more sedative than just venlafaxine alone. prob a little less so :)
SMM4H2022Pvxy43KlnUc0DWhe	@USER_ @USER______ venlafaxine withdrawal is worse than most by miles x
SMM4H2022HTfyhYjscvwFUOqF	"i just have to remember that what i'm feeling is the withdrawal from the venlafaxine. when my meds come, i will get better."
SMM4H2022O500uvOMPL6a3hQK	but i'm happy to be clean. just really really really really really really really sucked going from 100mg desvenlafaxine / day to zero.

SMM4H2022TnqyZ6TdfCgoioYR	if you're taking vyvanse can we please discuss side effects real quick wtf is happening to my digestive system
SMM4H2022YuGbgHKQTLCJkM3l	my vyvanse is seriously about to drive me crazy
SMM4H2022IQuKNDp1pOwpsS24	the only bad thing about vyvanse is the awful headache you get when it's starting to wear off ?
SMM4H2022XVZWIrVqYfwgXw0m	took a vyvanse for the first time in a month feelin weird.
